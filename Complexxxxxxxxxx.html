Geometry Dash is a side-scrolling music platforming game series developed by Robert Topala.
The game was released on 13 August 2013 on iOS and Android, and the Windows and macOS versions on 22 December 2014.
In Geometry Dash, players control the movement of an icon and navigate music-based levels while avoiding obstacles such as spikes.
Geometry Dash consists of 26 full-length levels made by its developer, RobTopGames; 22 are auto-scrolling, and 4 are 'platformer' levels. 
It has a level creation system, where players can create their own custom levels, share them online and play levels designed by other players.
In-game currency, such as stars, moons, coins, mana orbs or diamonds, can be obtained from various sources, such as levels (both official and user-created) or chests.
Three other spin-off games in the series have been made: Geometry Dash Meltdown, Geometry Dash World and Geometry Dash SubZero.</p>
